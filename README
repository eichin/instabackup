instabackup is a quick hack to back up your instagram stream. I put it together in 20 mins. It's raw. I don't care.

Run it, and it'll download all the photos from yuor instagram feed into the current directory, named with the upload date and title. It won't re-download files that already exist, so you can safely run it nightly and just download new photos if you want to do that.

The first time you run it, it'll need authentication. OAuth2 doesn't seem to have a pure desktop flow, so you'll end up on a page on movieos.org that will give you a token to cut and paste back to the command line. Not the best of solutions, but it'll do. It'll cache the token in a file called `.instabackup.token` in your home directory, and subsequent runs won't need authenticating.

I think that's it. Tell me (tom@movieos.org) if it breaks.
